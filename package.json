  "description": "Welcome! This repo serves as a complete example for how to build a smart contract fully compliant with NFT-standards. This repo brings Avataaars, an open-source avatar generator, to the blockchain, randomly generating avatars for users and storing them as NFTs. It makes full use of  [Metadata Standards](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/master/contracts/MetadataViews.cdc) needed for NFTs to be compatible with the Flowty marketplace and suite of products. Enjoy!",
